# Java-Project-1-Final-FiCT-2018
Project 1: Final FiCT (reads Final Fi-See-Tee)  
This is an individual project.

## Learning Objectives
On the course of implementing this programming project, you will learn some of the basic concepts of
object oriented programming and how to apply them to practical, real world programming applications.
Specifically, upon accomplishing this project, we expect you to be able to:
1. Differentiate and explain the purposes of:
- private, public, static, and final class variables.
- static, void, and returning methods.
2. Implement classes.
3. Instantiate objects from a class and use constructors to initialize objects.
4. Model entities and situations using objects, each of which has certain properties and exhibits
certain abilities.
5. Strengthen your overall programming skills.
6. Get a glimpse of needs for abstraction, interfaces, inheritance, and polymorphism.
7. Enjoy coding with Java.

## Introduction
In this project, you will be implementing a program that simulates the gameplay of a turn-based twoteam battle game, Final FiCT. The skeleton java files are provided. Your task is to understand the
gameplay, and implement the methods in the provided skeleton java files which are currently left blank
for you to fill in the missing code. A test class (StudentTester) is provided for you to check your outputs
and help you to debug your code.
